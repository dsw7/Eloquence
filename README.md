## Motivation
I wanted to keep track of devices in my local area network "at the click of a button" (or more specifically,
via one command), and I also like working with hierarchical data structures such as XML trees. Pairing `nmap`
XML output with custom tree traversal algorithms affords me that opportunity.

## Setup
Compile the binary by running:
```console
make compile
```
Try running:
```console
elo --help  # or elo -h
```
To ensure that the binary was installed under `$PATH`. A help menu should be printed to `stdout`.

## Usage
Simply run:
```console
./scan
```
This bash script will run `nmap` and may require elevated privileges. After an XML report is generated, the
script will run `elo` to parse the XML and display the results in a sensical format.
